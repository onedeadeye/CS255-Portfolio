Liam Daley's portfolio for CS 255

Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
- DriverPass is a driving instruction firm aiming to capitalize on a perceived failure to properly educate drivers by offering online practice testing and instructional sessions. Their needs entailed an online service usable for bookings, administration, and user data handling to streamline their processes and allow customers to access DriverPass from anywhere.

What did you do particularly well?
- I am particularly proud of the completeness present in the business requirements document. I believe the specifications there are exact, describe the system accurately, and contain minimal excess specifications. The language is clear and direct, both keeping the needs of the customer and the team in mind.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
- I would choose to revise some of the diagrams created for the project. I believe they utilize detail and specificity in the wrong places, while occasionally neglecting certain client needs. The diagrams utilize the procedures correctly, however the content selected for inclusion could use revision.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
- In system design, user needs are paramount to the final design. Without accounting properly for user needs, the final product will not align with the goals the customer had initially when the system was envisioned. For the DriverPass system, we were provided with a comprehensive transcript of an interview between the customer and product managers that contained key insight into the expectations and requirements the customer had of the system. This resource was invaluable when identifiying customer needs and comparing designs to the requested system.

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
- In the future, I will utilize more iterative design strategies to refine systems over time, including feedback from clients into the process. Overall, my approach is use case-centric, focusing on the exact functional requirements the system needs to ensure the exact solution is built and no more, saving time and money for both the client and developers.
